# Microservices Architecture Pattern
* Below Patterns are covered as part of this documentation: 
   1. **[Strangler Fig Pattern](./1-strangler-fig-pattern.md)**: Facilitates the gradual replacement of a monolithic system with microservices, ensuring a smooth and risk-free transition.
   2. **API gateway Pattern**: Centralizes external access to your microservices, simplifying communication and providing a single entry point for client requests.
   3. **Backend for frontend (BFF)**: Creates dedicated backend services for each frontend, optimizing performance and user experience tailored to each platform.
   4. **Service Discovery Pattern**: Enables microservices to dynamically discover and communicate with each other, simplifying service orchestration and enhancing system scalability 
   5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Implements a fault tolerance mechanism for microservices preventing cascading failures by automatically detecting and isolating faulty services. 
   6. **Bulkhead pattern**: Isolates microservices into separate partitions, preventing failures in one partition from effecting the entire system enhancing system resilience. 
   7. **Retry Pattern**: Enhances microservices resilience by automatically retrying failed operations, increasing the chances of successful execution and minimizing transient issues.
   8. **Sidecar Pattern**: Attaches additional components to your microservices, providing modular functionality without altering the core service itself. 
   9. **Saga Pattern**: Manages distributed transactions across multiple microservices, ensuring data consistency while maintaining the autonomy of your services. 
   10. **Event driven architecture pattern**: Leverages events to trigger actions in your services, promoting loose coupling between services and enabling real-time responsiveness. 
   11. **CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Separation)**: Separates the read and write operations in a microservice, improving performance, scalability, and maintainability. 
   12. **Configuration Externalization Pattern**: Provides a method to externalize the configuration from the code, enabling microservices to be reconfigured without the need for recompilation or redeployment.

## Mind Map: Microservice Patterns
![img](./img/1_lFYeiqrxf4dUEEfe00isYw.png)

* **Goal**: Increase Velocity of application releases, by decomposing the application into small autonomous services that can be deployed independently. 
![microservices-patterns](./img/microservices-patterns.png)
1. Ambassador
    > **Definition**: Can be used to offload common client connectivity tasks such as monitoring, logging, routing and security in language agnostic way. 
2. Anti-Corruption Layer 
    > **Definition**: Implements Facade between new and legacy apps to ensure that design of a new app is not limited by dependencies on legacy system. 
3. Backends for Frontend
    > **Definition**: Creates separate backend services for different types of clients. Single backend service doesn't need to handle all conflicting requirements of various client types.
4. Bulkhead 
    > **Definition**: It isolates critical resources such as connection pool, memory and CPU for each workload or service. By using this, a single service cant starve others. This increases **resiliency** & **prevents cascading failures**
5. Gateway Aggregation
    > **Definition**: aggregates requests to multiple individual microservices into a single request, reducing chattiness between consumers and services.
6. Gateway Offloading
    > **Definition**: enables each microservice to offload shared service functionality, such as the use of SSL certificates, to an API gateway.
7. Gateway Routing 
    > **Definition**: routes requests to multiple microservices using a single endpoint, so that consumers don't need to manage many separate endpoints.
8. Sidecar
    > **Definition**: deploys helper components of an application as a separate container or process to provide isolation and encapsulation.
9. Strangler Fig 
    > **Definition**: supports incremental refactoring of an application, by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new services.

## Design Pattern Categories

### Data Management Patterns
* Data is typically hosted in different locations and across multiple servers for reasons such as performance, scalability or availability, and this can present a range of challenges.
* Additionally data should be protected at rest, in transit, and via authorized access mechanisms to maintain security assurances of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
