# UML (Unified Modeling Language) 
* UML is a way of visualizing and documenting a software system by using a collection of diagrams, which helps engineers, business people, and system architects understand the behavior and structure of the system being designed
<br/>

* Benefits of using UML:
    1. help develop a quick understanding of a software system
    2. UML modeling helps in breaking complex system into discrete pieces that can be easily understood.
    3. UML graphical notations can be used to communicate design decisions. 
    4. Since UML is independent of any specific platform or language or tech, it is easier to abstract out concepts. 
    5. It becomes easier to hand the system over to a new team.
    <br/>
* UML has **14 different diagrams** which belong to 2 main groups: **structural diagram and behavioral or interaction diagrams**
* Structural Diagram analyze and depict the structure of system or process. 
* Behavioral Diagram depict the behaviour of the system, its actors, and its building components. 
<br/>

* Structural UML diagrams

    * `Class diagram`: Used to describe structure and behavior in the use cases, this diagram provides a **conceptual model of the system in terms of entities and their relationships.**
    * `Object diagram`
    * `Package diagram`
    * `Component diagram`
    * `Composite structure diagram`
    * `Deployment diagram`
    * `Profile diagram`
    <br/>
* Behavioral UML diagrams

    * `Use case diagram`: Used to describe a set of user scenarios, this diagram **illustrates the functionality provided by the system.**
    * `Activity diagram:` Used to model the **functional flow-of-control between two or more class objects**
    * `Sequence diagram`: Used to describe **interactions among classes in terms of an exchange of message over time**
    * `State diagram`
    * `Communication diagram`
    * `Interaction overview diagram`
    * `Timing diagram`
