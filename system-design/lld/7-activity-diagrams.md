# Activity Diagrams 
* **Illustrate flow of control in system** 
* Emphasis of **condition of flow** and the **sequence** in which it happens. 
* It shows **dynamic nature** of system. 
*  activity diagrams are used to model workflow or business processes and internal operations.

# What is the difference between Activity diagram and Sequence diagram?

* **Activity diagram** captures the process flow. It is used for functional modeling. A functional model represents the flow of values from external inputs, through operations and internal data stores, to external outputs.
* **Sequence diagram** tracks the interaction between the objects. It is used for dynamic modeling, which is represented by tracking states, transitions between states, and the events that trigger these transitions.
