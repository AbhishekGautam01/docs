# General Tips for High Level Design Interviews
1. Dont go into deep details initially. 
2. Don't have a set architecture in mind. Derive the design from requirement
3. Follow KISS(Keep it Simple Stupid)
4. Don't make points without having any points to back it up 
5. Be aware of things, like load balancer, dbs, off the shelf components, messaging queues. 
6. There cannot be a perfect right answer. There is nothing as one size fit all 
7. List all requirements - Don't assume things ask questions. 
8.  Take out 5 mins to plan for next 45 mins

* When designing large systems consider: 
    1. What are different architectural pieces that can be used?
    2. How these pieces work with each other. 
    3. How can we best utilize these pieces: What are the right tradeoffs?
