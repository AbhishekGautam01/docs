# Functional vs Non Functional Requirement
* **Functional Requirements**
  * Define various things the system must do.
  * In interview demonstrate the understanding of core underlying features of the system
* **NFR**
  * These are the quality attributes of the system
  * They define how the system does something rather then what it does. 
    * Scalability: System should be able to handle growth of users
    * Performance: Process the transaction within specified periods of time. 
    * Availability: System should be up and running for the defined period of time. 
    * Security: system must protect sensitive data and authorize the access
  * Show depth of design understand
  * Highlight system robustness and quality.

## integrating both in interviews. 
* **Scenario based discussion**: When presented with a scenario identify both functional and non functional requirements of the system. 
* **Balancing Act**: Balance both type of requirements.

## During interview
* Clarify requirements: Start asking question about both FRs and NFRs 
* Prioritize: Not all requirements are equal, find the most important first.
* Trade-offs:  Discuss trade-offs related to different architectural decisions, especially concerning non-functional requirements.
  * Eg: A system highly optimized for read operations may have a slower write operations
* Use real world examples or relate to your past experience.
* Balance: Ensure you are not focusing too much on one type of requirement.
