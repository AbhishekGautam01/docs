# Module System

* In react proj we have collection of files which have variables in them which want to be used in another file but this cannot be done without module system. 
* variables shared between files by import/export statements.

## Export Statements
* Used to make variable available to other files.
* Two types
  * Default: A file can only have a single default export `export default <name_of_variable>`
  * Named: 

## Import Statements
* Import the exported variables.
