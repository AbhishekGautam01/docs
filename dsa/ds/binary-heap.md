# Binary Heap 
* It is a **binary tree** with following properties: 
    1. **Complete Tree**: All levels completely filled except the last level and last level has all the keys as left as possible. This makes them suitable for them to be **sorted in array**
    2. **Min/Max Heap**: A binary heap is either min heap or max heap. For min heap, the key at root should be the smallest and same property recursively applies to all nodes.
